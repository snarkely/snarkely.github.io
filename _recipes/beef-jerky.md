## Beef Jerky

This is a modification of my uncle Geno’s beef jerky recipe. Always a crowd favorite.

* 5 lb lean ground beef (90% or better)
* 2 tsp Accent (leave this out if you’re avoiding MSG)
* 1 tsp cayenne pepper
* 2 tsp black pepper
* 2 tsp garlic powder
* 1 1/2 tsp cardamom
* 1 tsp ground marjoram
* 2 Tbs Kosher salt
* 2 Tbs liquid smoke
* 2 Tbs soy sauce
* 2 Tbs brown sugar
* 1 Tbs Worcestershire
* 2 Tbs red pepper flakes (optional, if you like it hot)

Mix together. Form into 1/8″ strips (I use a cookie press). Dehydrate for 10-12 hours.
